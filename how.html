                <span class="text">  How does a calorie counter work?</span> After you input data, it uses a formula  to calculate your resting metabolic rate.
                That's the number of calories your body needs to function when it is at rest.
                Then, based on your personalized lifestyle information, the calculator adds the number of calories you need to fuel your body for daily activity.
                Finally, it either adds calories to gain weight or subtracts calories to help you lose weight.

                </p>
                <p>
              <span class="text">But what if you want your weight to stay the same?</span>The calculator can figure out how many calories you should eat to maintain weight as well. This information is helpful for many healthy eaters.
              If you are at a healthy weight and want to maintain your body size, you should make sure that you don't eat too much or too little.
                </p>
                <p>
                <span class="text">  Are you ready to give the calorie calculator a try?</span> You'll need to provide some vital information about your age, gender, height, and your current weight to get the right calorie number. The calculator requires this data because these are factors that influence your metabolic rateâ€”or the number of calories that your body needs to function. In general, men need more calories than women. Larger bodies need more calories than smaller bodies, and younger adults require more calories than older adults.You'll also be asked about your activity habits. If your body is more active during the day, it requires more fuel (in the form of calories). Try to be as honest as possible about your exercise and daily activity habits. <br>
                When you complete the calorie calculator process, you'll get a daily calorie goal. This is the number of calories you should eat each day to reach your desired weight in the time frame that you set. If you are trying to gain weight, your daily calorie goal will include a calorie surplus. But if weight loss is your goal, a calorie deficit is factored into your final number. </p>
